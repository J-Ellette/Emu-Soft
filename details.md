# Emulated Software and Scripts

This directory contains copies of software, scripts, and code that were created by rewriting and perfecting existing tools and technologies. Each component was built from scratch without using the original external dependencies, following the principle of creating a self-contained civilian version of military-grade software assurance.

## Organization

Components are organized into subdirectories by category:

- **`analysis/`** - Code analysis and quality assessment tools
- **`assurance/`** - ARCOS assurance case components (DARPA-inspired)
- **`evidence/`** - Evidence collection and provenance tracking
- **`infrastructure/`** - Core infrastructure (cache, tasks, web, database)
- **`web/`** - Web components and visualization tools

Each subdirectory contains a detailed README.md with usage examples, API documentation, and integration guides.

## Purpose and Design Philosophy

All components in this directory were created following these principles:

1. **Zero External Dependencies**: Each emulation is self-contained and doesn't require installation of the original tool or service
2. **Civilian Adaptation**: Military-grade methodologies adapted for open source, enterprise, and SaaS use cases
3. **Educational Value**: Clear, readable code that demonstrates the core concepts of each emulated tool
4. **Production Ready**: Not just prototypes - these are fully functional implementations used throughout CIV-ARCOS
5. **Extensibility**: Designed to be extended and customized for specific organizational needs

## For Future Additions

When creating new emulations, add them to this directory and document:
- **Name and filename**
- **What it Replaces**
- **What it does** (detailed functionality description)
- **Original location** in the codebase


### CLI Commands:
```bash
# Create a new plugin
python mycms_cli.py create-plugin my_plugin --author "Your Name"

# Create a new theme
python mycms_cli.py create-theme my_theme --display-name "My Theme"

# Create a new content type
python mycms_cli.py create-content-type article
```

### Live Reload Usage:
```python
from mycms.dev_tools import serve_with_reload

# Start server with live reload
serve_with_reload(app, watch_dirs=["mycms", "themes"], port=8000)
```

## Design Philosophy

All components follow these principles:

1. **No Framework Lock-in:** Complete ownership of code
2. **Study First, Implement Second:** Learn from established patterns
3. **Start Simple, Add Complexity:** Progressive enhancement
4. **Keep Interfaces Familiar:** Similar APIs to known frameworks
5. **Full Transparency:** No black boxes, every line is understood

## Tools We Still Use (Not Emulated)

These are development tools, not architectural dependencies:

- **pytest** - Testing framework
- **black** - Code formatter
- **mypy** - Type checker
- **flake8** - Linter
- **coverage.py** - Code coverage
- **docker** - Containerization

## Benefits of This Approach

### Learning Benefits
- Deep understanding of how everything works
- No black boxes in the system
- Easy debugging through transparent code

### Architectural Benefits
- Perfect fit for specific needs
- No unnecessary features or bloat
- Optimized for specific use cases

### Maintenance Benefits
- Full control over updates
- No breaking changes from external dependencies
- Easy customization of any behavior
- Reduced security attack surface

## Adding New Emulated Components

When creating new emulated components:

1. Copy the component to `emu-soft/[component-name]/`
2. Update this `details.md` file with:
   - Component name and what it Replaces
   - Description of functionality
   - Key files and their purposes
3. Ensure the component follows the design philosophy
4. Add appropriate tests for the component
