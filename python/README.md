### Development Tools (Now in Individual Folders)
Development tools have been reorganized into separate folders at the repository root for better organization:

| Tool Folder | Emulates | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| pytest_emulator_tool/ | pytest | Test discovery, fixtures, and execution |
| coverage_emulator_tool/ | Coverage.py | Code coverage tracking with sys.settrace() |
| code_formatter_tool/ | Black | AST-based Python code formatter |
| live_reload_tool/ | uvicorn --reload | File watching and auto-reload for development |
| cms_cli_tool/ | Django manage.py, Rails generators | CMS scaffolding and code generation |

**Note:** Original implementations remain in `dev_tools/` for backward compatibility.

## Documentation

All folders now include comprehensive README.md files with:
- Component descriptions and features
- Usage examples
- API documentation
- Integration guides
- Performance characteristics

**Key Documentation Files:**
- **script_descriptions.md** - Complete listing of all 125+ scripts organized by folder
- **details.md** - Comprehensive documentation of all components
- **Folder READMEs** - Detailed documentation for each module
- **build-docs/** - Step completion documentation

## Using These Files

These are **copies** of the actual implementation files for reference and documentation purposes. The working versions are located in their respective directories within the `civ_arcos/` package:

- `civ_arcos/core/` â†’ Infrastructure emulations
- `civ_arcos/analysis/` â†’ Analysis tool emulations
- `civ_arcos/web/` â†’ Web component emulations
- `civ_arcos/assurance/` â†’ ARCOS methodology emulations
- `civ_arcos/evidence/` â†’ Evidence system emulations
- `civ_arcos/storage/` â†’ Graph database
- `civ_arcos/adapters/` â†’ External service adapters

## Adding New Emulations

When creating new software by emulating existing tools:

1. **Determine the category** (analysis, assurance, evidence, infrastructure, web)
2. **Copy the file** to the appropriate subdirectory
3. **Update the subdirectory README** with component details
4. **Update details.md** with comprehensive documentation
5. **Update this README** with a new entry in the Quick Reference table

This ensures we maintain a complete record of all emulated components.

## Purpose

This directory serves multiple purposes:

1. **Documentation** - Clear record of what we've emulated
2. **Compliance** - Demonstrates originality of implementations
3. **Reference** - Easy access to emulated components for study
4. **Attribution** - Proper credit to original tool concepts
5. **Licensing** - Clear separation of emulated vs. external dependencies

## License

All files in this directory are original implementations written from scratch for the CIV-ARCOS project. While they emulate the functionality of existing tools, they contain no copied code from those tools. See details.md for attribution of concepts and methodologies.
