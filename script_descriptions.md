## Emulation Philosophy

All scripts in this repository were created by:
1. Understanding the original tool's purpose and features
2. Implementing core functionality from scratch
3. Using only Python standard library (with minimal exceptions)
4. Maintaining API compatibility where possible
5. Adding documentation and tests
6. Ensuring integration with the broader system

This approach ensures:
- No licensing issues
- Complete control over functionality
- Educational value in understanding tool internals
- Self-contained, dependency-free operation
- Suitable for military-grade assurance requirements
