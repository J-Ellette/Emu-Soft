We have successfully emulated and recreated the following technologies:
- Django
- FastAPI
- Flask
- Django ORM
- SQLAlchemy
- Peewee/Tortoise - Lighter ORMs
- Django-allauth
- Authlib
- PassLib
- Django Templates
- Jinja2
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Pydantic
- Django Cache Framework
- Redis-py / aioredis
- Django Admin
- Flask-Admin
- Django Security Middleware

Now we want to do the same with the following:

## pytest (COMPLETE)
Feasibility: Very High
Why: Test discovery, fixture management, and assertion rewriting are well-understood patterns
Core Components: Test runner, fixture system, assertion introspection, plugin architecture
Complexity: Medium - mainly involves AST manipulation and dynamic code execution

## Coverage.py (COMPLETE)
Feasibility: High
Why: Code coverage tracking using Python's sys.settrace() is straightforward
Core Components: Trace function, line tracking, branch analysis, reporting
Complexity: Medium - requires understanding Python's execution tracing

## Black - Code Formatter (COMPLETE)
Feasibility: High
Why: AST parsing and code generation are well-documented
Core Components: AST parser, style rules engine, code regeneration
Complexity: Medium-High - requires deep AST understanding but no external dependencies

## MyPy - Type Checking
Feasibility: Medium-High
Why: Type inference and checking algorithms are academic concepts you can implement
Core Components: Type inference engine, constraint solver, error reporting
Complexity: High - complex algorithms but achievable

## Flake8 - Linting
Feasibility: Medium
Why: Static analysis is well-understood, but comprehensive rule sets are extensive
Core Components: AST analysis, rule engine, plugin system
Complexity: Medium - simpler than MyPy but requires many rules

Go through each of the folders and determine the script(s) within each one is emulating - collect the name of that script or group of scripts, or the name of script or group of scripts if they are uniquely new scripts. Regroup the scripts in to new folders, if needed, to keep like types together. Use your best judgement in grouping and naming. Make sure each folder has documentation, readme, etc.,
Make a new descriptions.md to list the results, grouped by folder name.
